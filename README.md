# Something's Rotten at the Gilded Rose: A Refactoring Tale

Our tale begins at the Gilded Rose, a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city run by a friendly innkeeper named Allison.  This quant inn sells a limited range of high-quality goods such as Aged Brie, Sulfuras, and concert tickets.
Our unassuming hero developer has been hired to update the innâ€™s inventory system so Allison can sell conjured items.  A simple task, or so it seems.  Little does our hero know the perils and smells that await them in the rotten inventory source code.

Learn when and how to refactor in this hands-on presentation as we follow our hero through their refactoring journey of the famous Gilded Rose Kata.
